Explore dataset of U.S. births from 1994-2003 (complied by [FiveThirtyEight](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/births/US_births_1994-2003_CDC_NCHS.csv)).

Next steps:

- Write a function that can calculate the min and max values for any dictionary that's passed in.
- Write a function that extracts the same values across years and calculates the differences between consecutive values to show if number of births is increasing or decreasing.
- For example, how did the number of births on Saturday change each year between 1994 and 2003?
- Find a way to combine the CDC data with the SSA data, which you can find here. Specifically, brainstorm ways to deal with the overlapping time periods in the datasets.
